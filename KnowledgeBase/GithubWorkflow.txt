1. Make Your Changes üìù
This is the most important step! You'll be working on your C++ code, adding new files, modifying existing ones, and so on.

2. Check the Status of Your Changes üëÄ
Before you do anything else, run the git status command. This will show you exactly which files you've modified, which are new and "untracked," and which are staged for a commit. This is your reality check.

3. Stage Your Changes for a Commit ‚úÖ
When you're happy with a set of changes and want to save them together as a single snapshot, you need to stage them.

git add .

The . in this command tells Git to add all new and modified files in your current directory and its subdirectories. This is a very common and efficient way to stage everything at once.

4. Create a Commit üíæ
Once your changes are staged, you can create a commit. A commit is a permanent snapshot of your staged files in your local repository.

git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"

The -m flag lets you write a short, descriptive message directly in the command. Your message should be a brief summary of what you did in this commit. For example, "Added new function for calculating CGPA" or "Fixed a bug in the main loop."

5. Push Your Changes to GitHub üöÄ
This is the final step to share your work with the world (or just yourself on another computer).

git push

Because you have already configured the remote, Git knows exactly where to send your changes. It will take all the commits you made locally and upload them to your GitHub repository.

A Note on Best Practices üí°
Commit Often: It's better to have many small, meaningful commits than one giant commit at the end of the day. This makes it easier to track your progress and revert changes if something goes wrong.

Check git status regularly: It's a great habit to run git status frequently to keep track of your changes.

Create a good .gitignore: You've already done this! A good .gitignore file prevents you from accidentally adding temporary files, build files, and other unnecessary items to your repository. This keeps your repository clean and focused on your source code.

Essential Git Commands
Here are the most common Git commands you'll use, along with what they do.

1. git status
This command is your best friend. It shows you the current state of your repository. It will tell you which files have been modified, which are new and not yet being tracked, and which are ready to be committed.

2. git add <file_name>
This is how you tell Git to start tracking a new file or stage changes for an existing file.

git add main.cpp: This adds only your main.cpp file to the staging area.

git add .: This is a shortcut to add all new and modified files in the current directory and its subdirectories. Use this with caution, as it will add everything, including temporary files.

3. git commit -m "Your commit message"
This command creates a snapshot of the files that are currently in your staging area.

-m stands for "message." The text inside the quotes is your commit message. It's a required part of the command and should be a short, clear description of the changes you made.

4. git push
This is what you use to send your committed changes from your local computer to your GitHub repository.

The first time you push, you'll need to link your local branch to the remote one. The terminal will often give you the exact command to use, which looks something like git push --set-upstream origin main. After that, you can just use git push.

Git Branching
A branch is essentially a lightweight, movable pointer to a snapshot of your project. When you create a new branch, you are not making a full copy of your project; you are just creating a new pointer that you can move around as you make changes.

git branch <branch-name>: This command creates a new branch, but you remain on your current branch.

git checkout <branch-name>: This command switches you to the specified branch. All changes you make from now on will be on this new branch, leaving the original branch unchanged.

git checkout -b <new-branch-name>: This is a convenient shortcut that both creates a new branch and immediately switches to it.

Branches are used to isolate your work. For example, you can create a new branch for a new feature you're working on. This way, if you introduce a bug, it won't affect the main, stable version of the code.

################################################################################################################################################

Git Merging
Merging is the process of combining a set of changes from one branch into another. When you are finished working on a feature branch, you will want to merge your changes back into the main branch.

git merge <branch-to-merge-in>: This command integrates the changes from the specified branch into your current branch.

First, make sure you are on the branch you want to merge into (e.g., main). Use git checkout main.

Then, run the merge command to bring in the changes from your feature branch. For example, git merge feature-x.

There are two main types of merges:

Fast-Forward Merge: This happens when the branch you are merging into has not had any new commits since you created your feature branch. Git simply moves the pointer of the main branch forward to the tip of your feature branch.

Three-Way Merge: This is a more common scenario where both your main branch and your feature branch have new commits. Git creates a new "merge commit" that combines the changes from both branches. This is where merge conflicts can occur.

A Simple Workflow
Here's a common workflow using these commands:

Start on your main branch: git checkout main

Pull the latest changes to ensure you're up to date: git pull origin main

Create a new branch for your feature: git checkout -b new-feature

Make your changes and commit them: git add ., then git commit -m "added new feature"

Switch back to the main branch: git checkout main

Merge your feature branch into the main branch: git merge new-feature

Delete the now-merged feature branch (optional but good practice): git branch -d new-feature
